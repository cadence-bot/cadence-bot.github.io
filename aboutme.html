  <p>Hi! My name is Cadence (she/her), and I study Classics with a languages and literature focus at Grinnell College.</p>
    <p>I'm interested in conceptions of the sea, (conceptions of & real) birds, things that look like other things, and collaging.</p>
    <p>If you feel so inspired, you can contact me at chencade[@]grinnell[.]edu.</p>
